## Sprint 1 (JS/State) - Build Project: Mind Reader
### Project Brief:
For this project, we will be implementing state management with JavaScript to create a single page web app that plays a game with the user to read their mind. The focus is to use state management to progress forward to the next view, backward to the previous view, and reset to the first view page.

By default, the app should prompt the user to click through the single-page app and see a new view for every step. You need to be able to scroll through the numbers to find your symbol. The mind reader also happens to have a fun math gimmick based on the factors of 9. This is not something you need to program, people will do the math in their heads.

### Objective:
Learn how to use state using the Mind Reader project.

### Requirements:
To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:
- Pseudocode the problem in its entirety before you start coding.
- Use JavaScript to successfully show the transition from one view to the next view.
- Successfully show state management for each step of the single page app ("view" 1, 2, 3, ...).
    - Only create a single index.html.
    - No need to refresh the page (manually or using JS).
    - Update state using a variable that tells the computer what 'view' it is.
    - Use functions to move forward a view, backward, reset to the first view, and display the correct view on load / after every state change.
- Use Icons of your choice, we recommend either Bootstrap Icons (best) or Font Awesome (second best) but feel free to find your own.
- All multiples of 9 should be the same symbol (this is important for the math gimmick to work).
